## Hello, I am Jonny Morsicato 👋

#### About Me

After graduating Colorado School of Mines I started work as a freelance gig worker part-time while running a small media collective I Founded, [The Coyote Collective](https://www.thecoyotecollective.com). Every moment of free time I get I am working to refine my data science skills and learn more about how I can better understand the world through data. I want to combine the modern skills of Machine Learning/AI, programming, scraping, munging, and visualization with the ancient art of story telling. 

### Current Skills 

- __Languages:__ Python, R, C++, Java
- __Machine Learning:__ Keras, Spark, Tensorflow, Sklearn
- __Data Visualization:__ Plotly, Matplotlib, ggplot, Seaborn
- __Other:__ Jupyter Notebooks, Django, Creative Writing, Storytelling

### Currently Working on

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a CNN that takes in financial data as an image and makes a "Buy,Sell, Hold" prediction
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the Andrew Ng Machine Learning Course through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any ML vision or financial trading project
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding how to design the layers in a CNN

### Favorite Poem

There's a race of men that don't fit in,
A race that can't stay still;
So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
And they roam the world at will.
They range the field and they rove the flood,
And they climb the mountain's crest;
Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,
And they don't know how to rest.
