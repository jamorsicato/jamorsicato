#### About Me

I currently work as a gig worker part time while running a small media colective I Co-Founded, [The Coyote Collective][https://www.thecoyotecollective.com]. Every moment of free time I get I am working to refine my data science skills and learn more about how I can better understand the world through the massive amount of available data. I want to combine the modern skills of Machine Learning/AI, programming, scraping, munging, and visualization with the ancient art of story telling. My dream is to help bridge the gap between science and the everyday person.

### Favorite Poem 

There's a race of men that don't fit in,
    A race that can't stay still;
So they break the hearts of kith and kin,
    And they roam the world at will.
They range the field and they rove the flood,
    And they climb the mountain's crest;
Theirs is the curse of the gypsy blood,
    And they don't know how to rest.
